<div>
    A library built on top of <code>pymongo</code> allowing users to route to their <code>mongo</code> collections
    using only the collection name.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    This package abstracts away connection data, database info and even the collection name used by the database.

    Using a configurable set of rules, <code>MongoRouter</code> allows users to access their collection like this.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <code>
    mongo = MongoRouter()
    <br/>
    mongo.route("my_collection")
    </code>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <code>MongoRouter</code> will know, based on the configuration, what machine it should connect to,
    what database on that machine it should access and what collection in that database corresponds to <i>my_collection</i>.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    You can get the package with <code>pip install MongoRouter</code>.
